# IE401
Senior Design Project of Sefa Yapıcı, Yağmur Hızlı, Eyüb Ensari Topcan, Ege Göztepe, Sena Uslu and Zeynep Çoban.

# bitirmeDataPreparation.py 
Takes the input data in and manipulates it, making it ready to be used in simulation process. Also, we calculate safety stocks and reorder points for each raw material here. 

# SeniorDesignSSOrderingPolicySimulation.py
Creates the simulation framework that we ran experiments in.

# combined_steps.py
Where we create and run our main experiments.

# Computational_results.py 
Creates the output that will be shown to the decision maker.

# Sensitivity_Analysis.py
Runs sensitivity analysis on different unknown variables to understand their effects on simulation better
